# OnlineMonopoly-Server
An online variant of Monopoly that I developed as my senior capstone. This is the server component.

It is a simple console window that logs what happens in the game and displays potential errors. It also displays messages relating to the status of the game and the server, such as when players disconnect and when a new game state is started.
